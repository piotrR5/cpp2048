My implementation of "2048" game.

To build the game use ```./build.sh```, if you don't have required dependencies run ```./build_dependencies.sh```

to run the game use command ```./2048```, if you want to play with custom plane size type ```./2048 n``` where n is the length of a side of the game.

have fun
